Omnibus packages must be built on the target distro so I needed images for centos, debian and ubuntu. Usually I build such docker images on my laptop which is running Ubuntu; I try to make the builds as repeatable as possible using the excellent packer tool and when I publish images I build them again (using a build server) on cloud instances. In this case, I was using GCE CentOS 7 instance to perform the build and I was surprised when a build that was smooth on my laptop failed miserably.</description></item></channel></rss>
