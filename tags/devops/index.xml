&lt;p>&lt;strong>Configuration&lt;/strong> is one of those things we usually take for granted. Yet, as more and more configurations are added the use of configurations becomes hard and complicated. With enough configuration parameters, keeping track of what the current configuration “is” can be quite problematic. Often, people misconfigure systems due to various reasons such as poor documentation or unexpected interactions between different parameters. Sometimes, the configuration itself can be complex and requires a language to express it, raising the bar of required knowledge for defining the configuration. Despite the “boring” nature of configurations they can and do &lt;a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/08/02/knight-capital-says-trading-mishap-cost-it-440-million">obliterate entire companies in matter of hours&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Docker, SELinux and the myth of kernel independence</title><link>https://www.fewbytes.com/docker-selinux-and-the-myth-of-kernel-independence/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2014 17:05:12 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.fewbytes.com/docker-selinux-and-the-myth-of-kernel-independence/</guid><description>Recently I built docker images for omnibus builds. Omnibus packages must be built on the target distro so I needed images for centos, debian and ubuntu. Usually I build such docker images on my laptop which is running Ubuntu; I try to make the builds as repeatable as possible using the excellent packer tool and when I publish images I build them again (using a build server) on cloud instances. In this case, I was using GCE CentOS 7 instance to perform the build and I was surprised when a build that was smooth on my laptop failed miserably.</description></item><item><title>How to prevent Continuous Deployment from turning into a Continuous Disaster</title><link>https://www.fewbytes.com/how-to-prevent-continuous-deployment-from-turning-into-a-continuous-disaster/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Apr 2013 15:45:50 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://www.fewbytes.com/how-to-prevent-continuous-deployment-from-turning-into-a-continuous-disaster/</guid><description>These days, one the of most frequent request we hear from clients is setting up continuous deployment. Every company wants it, every DevOps related conference has sessions about it. However, newcomers tend to miss one of the key points of CI/CD – it really isn’t an automation problem, it’s a cultural problem. From a pure technical perspective implementing a build-deploy pipeline is fairly simple with current tools and this has been the case for several years.</description></item><item><title>IT is NOT ops</title><link>https://www.fewbytes.com/it-is-not-ops/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Feb 2013 15:06:49 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.fewbytes.com/it-is-not-ops/</guid><description>At the end of DevopsCon I participated in a panel discussing the future of Ops and DevOps. One thread of discussion at that panel followed a statement by Ben Kepes which basically amounted to &amp;ldquo;in the future, there won&amp;rsquo;t be any IT Ops guys anymore&amp;rdquo; (I can&amp;rsquo;t remember the exact wording, apologies). I was very disturbed by that statement; not because of fear for my profession, but rather because of the lack of dismay in the crowd.</description></item></channel></rss>
